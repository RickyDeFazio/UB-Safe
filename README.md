# UB-Safe

### Computer Science Project for University at Buffalo
> This was my first coding project.

Implemented data from a crime api to produce a visual representation of local criminal activity. The app also collects additional data from neighborhood residents via a survey.

Utilized: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Flask.

To run this app:

```
export FLASK_APP=server.py
python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
 ```
