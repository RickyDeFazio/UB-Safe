# UBSafe

This is a web application that I built for my first coding project. It uses a crime api from the city of Buffalo to showcase the criminal activity as it continues to occur in recent time. The app has the ability to collect additional data from neighborhood residents via an online survey.

This project utilizes JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Flask to achieve it's task.
